## üìù Comprehensive Changelog: Initial Project Setup

The current staged changes introduce the foundational structure and core functionality of the project. This is a significant commit encompassing all necessary files for the initial working version.

### ‚ú® New Features & Core Implementation

This commit sets up the entire project environment and introduces the primary logic:

*   **Project Structure Initialization:** Established the basic file structure, including configuration and documentation files.
*   **Core Logic Implementation:** The primary application logic is contained within `main.py` and supported by utility functions in `tools.py`.
*   **Dependency Management:** Defined all necessary Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
*   **Documentation:** Created a comprehensive `README.md` to guide setup and usage.

### üìÅ Files Added (7 Total)

| Status | File Path | Purpose |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | `.env.example` | Template for environment variables and configuration. |
| **A** | `.gitignore` | Standard exclusion list for version control (e.g., virtual environment, logs). |
| **A** | `Changelogs/staged_20251031_162251.md` | Initial generated changelog file (internal tracking). |
| **A** | `README.md` | Project overview, installation instructions, and usage guide. |
| **A** | `main.py` | The main entry point and execution script for the application. |
| **A** | `requirements.txt` | List of required Python packages (dependencies). |
| **A** | `tools.py` | Utility module containing reusable functions and helper logic. |

### üéØ Impact and Purpose

The primary purpose of this commit is to lay the groundwork for the entire application. It moves the project from zero files to a fully structured, functional state.

*   **Setup:** Ensures all collaborators can quickly set up the environment using `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, and `.env.example`.
*   **Functionality:** The combination of `main.py` and `tools.py` provides the initial working implementation of the project's core task.
*   **Maintainability:** Establishes standards for documentation and dependency tracking from the start.
